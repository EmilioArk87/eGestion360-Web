- **Navigation Property**: `ICollection<User> Users`

## Usage Examples

```csharp
// Creating a new company
var company = new Company
{
    Name = "Acme Corporation",
    LegalName = "Acme Corporation S.A. de C.V.",
    TaxId = "ABC123456789",
    Address = "Av. Reforma 123",
    City = "Ciudad de MÃ©xico",
    State = "CDMX",
    PostalCode = "01000",
    Country = "MX",
    Phone = "+52 55 1234 5678",
    Email = "contacto@acme.mx",
    Currency = "MXN",
    TimeZone = "GMT-6",
    Language = "es"
};

// Associating a user with a company
user.CompanyId = company.Id;
user.Company = company;
```

## Database Migration
The Company table was added via migration `20251002040801_AddCompanyTable`.

To apply the migration to your database:
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

## Multi-Tenant Considerations
- Each company represents a separate tenant in the system
- Users are associated with companies via the CompanyId foreign key
- Company-specific settings (currency, timezone, language) can be used throughout the application
- The TaxId field ensures each company is uniquely identified
- The IsActive flag allows for soft deletion/deactivation of companies
